 *
 * Main & root contract implementing the first level of Pandora Boxchain consensus
 * See section ["3.3. Proof of Cognitive Work (PoCW)" in Pandora white paper](https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/%40pandoraboxchain/world-decentralized-ai-on-blockchain-with-cognitive-mining-and-open-markets-for-data-and-algorithms-pandora-boxchain)
 * for more details.
 *
 * Contract token functionality is separated into a separate contract named PAN (after the name of the token)
 * and Pandora contracts just simply inherits PAN contract.

    /// is used to ensure uniqueness of the factories and the fact that their code source is coming from the same
